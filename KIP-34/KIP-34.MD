## Background

### Summary

This budget outlines current and forecasted needs for various areas of Rook Labs operations for the remainder of Q3 and Q4, or through December 31 2022 (“Budget Period”).

This budget, if approved, will allow for the transfer of requested funds from the Rook DAO Treasury (0x9a67F1940164d0318612b497E8e6038f902a00a4) to the Rook Labs multisig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006). In addition to 5 ETH to pay for network fees, the funds requested in relation the current assets held by labs [3] are as follows:

![first table](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20image1.png)


![second table](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20image2.png)

Based on the Treasury’s financial position [1], this net funding amount would equate to less than 2% of our stablecoin balance as of September 26, 2022.

Note: While much of the costs requested are expected to fund ongoing programs and initiatives, approximately $403k (or 58% of the requested funds) are anticipated to be used to support the development of new projects and objectives. These anticipated costs are highlighted in more detail in the Key Highlights sections below.

### Recap/Rationale

In February 2022, the Rook Labs team requested funding through KIP-15 [2] to support the ongoing operations and development of key Rook processes and infrastructure through June 30, 2022. More specifically, this proposal requested an allocation of 3,310 ROOK and $500,500 USDC to be transferred from the Treasury wallet to the Labs wallet.

The Rook Labs team used this budget to make progress on multiple fronts during the budget period, all of which can be found in the Labs Q2 report [3]. Labs also showed strong financial discipline in their spending, using less than 60% of the budgeted ROOK and approximately 70% of the budgeted USDC for a period longer than budgeted for.

The “budget-to-actual” tables below provide further detail of this discipline. “Actual” data presented below and pulled from the Lab’s Ledger [6] includes March 2022 as the budgeted amount are for March 1, 2022 through September 26, 2022. The following schedules present the Labs’ utilization of funding vs. what was allocated by the DAO:

The following schedules present the outflows by function from the Rook Labs’ dedicated multisig:

![fourth table](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20image%204.png)

### Term and Total Request

For what remains of 2022, Labs is budgeting total USDC and ROOK needs of approximately $689k and 1,500 ROOK units, respectively; however, because of the disciplined spending in the prior quarter, there is a large surplus of approximately $129.6k USDC already in the Labs wallet that is expected to offset this funding need by roughly 19%. The net funding amount of approximately $485k is expected to fund Labs through December 31, 2022 (“Budget Period”). The schedule below this reconciliation of budget funds to funds remaining from prior funding cycles:

## Budget Detail: Highlights

### Q4 Offsite

Occasional face-to-face meetups [7], including a mix of working on real tasks, brainstorming, and getting to know each other, are the lifeblood [8] of distributed teams and are demonstrated to increase productivity through cohesiveness [9].

Some organizations meet up very regularly, up to once a quarter. Given our distributed team, this would not be practical nor financially viable. We will need to calibrate our perfect ratio as we understand our team dynamics more in depth. As initial step, we have started organizing our first full team meeting, taking some non-negotiable design elements into account:

* Key Deliverables: retrospective, prioritization and planning for Q1-Q2 2023; brainstorming session at team and organization level; strengthen human connections, to boost the team ability to deliver.
* Location: proximity to the majority of team members (to limit cost of travel and cost of jet lag); we opted for a destination in Mexico, as it provides better cost efficiency than locations within the United States.
* Venue: preference for a single facility with the possibility of cooking own meals and strong wi-fi to be able to work from.
* Duration: 4-5 nights

The meetup week will take place October (24th to the 29th). The expected cost breakdown is below.

### ETH Requirements

We intend to use 5 ETH for network fees incurred during the transfer of grants over the budget period. The increase in ETH funds requested can be attributed to the following factors:

* The new Compensation 3.1 structure requires that the ROOK component of contributor compensation be disbursed to each contributor monthly.
* With additional contributors and other meaningful activity, we have exhausted budgeted ETH funds quicker than expected in previous quarters. The previous quarter’s funding was utilized in full in approximately 6 weeks, resulting in contributors using personal funds to cover gas costs.


## Implementation

### Multisig Implementation

This budget, if approved, will allow for the transfer of requested funds from the Rook DAO Treasury (0x9a67F1940164d0318612b497E8e6038f902a00a4) to the Rook Labs multisig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006). The current signers of the Rook DAO Labs multisig are:

* [@WhatsTheDeetz](https://forum.rook.fi/u/whatsthedeetz)
* [@Pai-Sho](https://forum.rook.fi/u/pai-sho)
* @JZ
* @Hazard

### Excess ROOK and USDC Rollover

The budget above represents in all cases an upper bound. It isn’t required that Labs spend all of it, and we do not seek to. If excess ROOK or USDC exists at the end of the budget period, it will carry over into the subsequent budget period unless superceded by another KIP.

## Specification

1. Transfer, 560,177 USDC, 17 ROOK, and 5 ETH (for gas) from theRook DAO Treasury (0x9a67F1940164d0318612b497E8e6038f902a00a4) to the Rook DAO Labs multi-sig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006).
2. As appropriate, provide funding from the Rook DAO Labs multi-sig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006) to meet the needs outlined above during the budget period.
3. Ensure proper recordkeeping to provide for ongoing review of any transactions by the DAO on the public Labs Ledger [5].
4. Continue to provide detailed quarterly reporting to the DAO on expenses and revenues.
